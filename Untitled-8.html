            <h3 class="p2">  Out of all the ceremonies and functions in an Indian wedding, sangeet is the most vivacious and fun-filled
                pre-wedding function. The bride and grooms friends and family share a good-natured banter in the Sangeet ceremony. A
                couple's journey is portrayed in form of skits and dances by their closest friends and family, choreography being a
                huge part of the occasion.
                Sangeet is a memorable event for the couple filled with light moments, so it is important that the event stands out
                and leaves you with reminiscent memories. We handle everything from venue, decor, food, choreography so that you can
                sit back and enjoy your special day.</h3>

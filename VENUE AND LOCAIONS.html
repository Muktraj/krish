            <h3 class="p2"> A venue sets off the mood for the wedding, so when it comes down to selecting the venue for your wedding it is
                important that the venue reflects your personality and style. Perfect location for your dream wedding could be at a
                beach during sunset, beautiful church or traditional palace and we make it happen for you.
                We offer you various suggestions for the venue that sets as the perfect backdrop for the most important day of your
                life.
                We co-ordinate with venues and get you the best deal possible. Negotiation & management of the venue is also handled
                by us.</h3>
